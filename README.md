Introduction
This AI-based web application helps predict various medical conditions based on patient input. The system uses machine learning models trained on medical datasets to provide real-time predictions for:

Diabetes
Heart Disease
Parkinson’s Disease
Lung Cancer
Hypo-Thyroid
Built with Streamlit, this app provides a user-friendly interface for easy medical diagnosis.

Technologies Used
Python 
Streamlit (for UI)
Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, Pickle)
Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Usage
Open the web application.
Select the disease you want to predict.
Enter the required patient details.
Click on the "Test Result" button.
Get the diagnosis result instantly.

Model Details
The project uses pre-trained ML models stored in the /Models directory:
Diabetes: diabetes_model.sav
Heart Disease: heart_disease_model.sav
Parkinson’s: parkinsons_model.sav
Lung Cancer: lungs_disease_model.sav
Thyroid: Thyroid_model.sav
Each model is trained using medical datasets and optimized for high accuracy.
